# Link-ish

This extension allows you to force a "fake link" (that was created using JS click handlers) to behave somewhat like a real link.

## Why?

> Don't you hate it when a site or web app has a link that looks like a link, responds like a link on hover, but once you click it, you realize it's not a link? 
> 
> When this happens, you can't open it in new tab even
> if you right click it. You can't even if you
> `Ctrl`+`Click` it.
>
> Blame JavaScript.

## Features

This is a WIP.

1. `Ctrl`+`Click` Opens a fake link in a new tab.
